## Project Overview:
Hey everyone! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve finally completed my Netflix clone project. It took a bit longer than anticipated, but it was a great learning experience! ðŸ˜…

Initially, I was going to use static data for movies, series, and TV shows. Then, I discovered the TMDB API, which provides a wealth of dynamic data such as popular movies, top-rated shows, trending collections, and more. The API was a game-changer, and I highly recommend checking it out!

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Content**: Pulls data from TMDB API for movies, shows, and collections.
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and Firestore for user data management.
- **YouTube Trailers**: Embedded trailers to enhance the viewing experience.

### Setup Instructions:
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **API Keys**: Youâ€™ll need your own Firebase and TMDB API keys.
    - Replace the Firebase keys in the `lib/firebase.prod.js` file.
    - Replace the TMDB API key in the `request.js` file located in the project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages.

3. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to launch the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

4. **Run Tests**: Use `npm test` to run the test suite in interactive watch mode.

5. **Build for Production**: Execute `npm run build` to create a production build. The app will be optimized for best performance.

6. **Eject Configuration**: If you need to customize the configuration, use `npm run eject`. (Note: This is a one-way operation and not reversible.)
